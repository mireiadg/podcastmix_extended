# podcastmix_extended


We expand the PodcastMix-real dataset from twenty to eighty recordings. The expansion was evaluated with the pre-trained UNet and ConvTasNet models from PodcastMix. The evaluation is realized with both objective and subjective metrics, from the objective point of view using bsseval and from the subjective point of view using webMUSHRA. Our addition performs the same or better than the original dataset, expanding its usefulness for testing new models for speech and music source separation tasks.
